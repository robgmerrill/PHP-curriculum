# Numbers
In any programming language you will need to spend some time learning how to work with numbers. 

Some people find programming intimidating because they weren't good at math in school. While there are some areas of programming that are math intensive you don't have to be a math wizard to be a great programmer! A great programmer tends to be a mixture of art and logic. 

You don't have to be a math expert in PHP but you will need to know how to handle numbers and use arithmetic operations. 

Let's get started!

## Number data types in PHP - Integers and Floating Point

### Integers

An integer data type is `0`, a positive whole number or negative whole number: `4`, `-11`, `456,000` and `-21,000,000` for example.

The floating point data type is a number, positive or negative, represented with a decimal: `-0.04` or `3.14` for example.

Practice:

Open new PHP repl.

1. Create a variable with any name you would like and assign an integer value to it. `echo` the variable to the terminal.

2. `echo` the newline `\n` character to the terminal.

3. Declare another variable with any name you choose and assign a floating point, decimal value to it then use `echo` to print to the terminal.

Possible Solution:
```
$age = 25;
echo age;

echo "\n";

$money_in_bank_account = 250.32;
echo money_in_bank_account;
```
